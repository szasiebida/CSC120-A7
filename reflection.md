- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I liked this assignmnet it was interesting to think about how classes differ from each other but still share a lot of the same basics. I struggled with coming up with methods to overload because I wasn't too sure what would be most useful. 

I overloaded the constructor in the house class to be the default values of my own house so that if someone doesn't know the details of their house they can still create one with wilson as the default. I also overloaded the constructor of the house class so that if someone didn't know the adress of the house, it would default to the smith mailing address. Using this constructor still allows for the input of all of the other values for the house. 

I overloaded the constructor of the library class to have a default so that even if none of the information about the attributes is known, a library can still be created. I made another overloaded constructor that has all of the previous default values but can be used if the person only knows the name of the library. This will be useful because the name of the library is the most basic peice of information. 

I overloaded the constructor for the cafe so that if the person knows no attributes of the cafe they can still construct one. I also overloaded the constructor to have default values for the amounts of materials so that if a person only knows the name and address of the cafe they can still construct one and have some starting materials to work with.
